## Components

The following components are used in this application:

- **App.js**: The main component that renders the restaurant menu.
- **List.js**: A reusable component that displays a list of items.
- **index.js**: The entry point of the application.

Feel free to modify and extend these components according to your needs.

## Data

The menu items are stored in the `data.js` file. You can update this file with your own menu items or modify the existing ones. Each menu item includes properties such as name, description, and price.

Make sure to import and use the updated data in the `App.js` component to reflect your changes in the menu.

That's it! You can now customize and build upon this basic React restaurant menu to suit your specific needs. Enjoy!
